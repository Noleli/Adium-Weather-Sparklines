## Weather Sparklines for Adium

This is an Adium Xtra script that uses the Forecast.io API to draw a sparkline of the forecasted temperature for the next 24 hours.

### Usage

Assuming you already have Adium, download the `Weather Sparklines.AdiumScript`. Before you can use it, you need to register for an API key from Forecast.io. Once you have that, double-click `Weather Sparklines.AdiumScript` to install it. Then set your status message to `/wxtemp{LAT LON YOURAPIKEY}`. Note the spaces between the latitude, longitude, and API key.

### Details

This probably isn’t really robust enough for a public release, so I’m just throwing it out here.
